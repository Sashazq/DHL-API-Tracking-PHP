This is a script that i wrote that is used to connect into DHL using the XML-PI to track shipments using the Air Way Bill. it can handle a single tracking number or as many as you feed into it (has been tested with 250 and other then taking a little time to run had no problems). automatically takes and breaks the array of tracking numbers into chunks and then sends the request to DHL making sure not to pass the max number that can be tracked per request then returns the results as a array.
